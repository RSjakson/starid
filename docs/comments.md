*recurrent neural network* rnns are about sequential processing and patterns in sequential data. they’re natural for time series and time varying systems. from an aerospace perspective, they’re the kalman filter, as opposed to the convnet’s static batch least squares.

*convolutional network* cnn using libstarid cpp eigen kernel and tensorflow training and inference

*triangles* find star triangles in the image, and candidate stars that meet the constraints implicit within the triangle. these constraints are effectively the rules for candidate stars. for example, if a triangle consists of star pairs ab and bc, then the third side is ac.
