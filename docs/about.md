*1990*

in the summer of ninety i was twenty one. the previous fall i’d become a research assistant with the hubble space telescope astrometry group, university of texas astronomy department and mcdonald observatory. the berlin wall had fallen in november. hubble had launched in april. i was living in a one room apartment by the back patio of a historic house just north of campus. my landlady martha ann zively, an eighty three year old local legend, lived overhead. rent was a hundred and fifty dollars. mobile phones, laptops, and the web were still on the horizon. twin peaks would appear in a few months, and the austin garage rock scene was as strange as ever.

paul hemenway explained the group’s projects and where i might be capable of helping. hst was designed to provide next generation active guiding. high angular resolution is useless if smeared by motion. three optical interferometers were mounted on robotic arms in the focal plane - the fine guidance sensors. an fgs would monitor a star and provide feedback to the hst attitude control system. the point was to simultaneously push the limits in two subsystems whose effects were highly coupled - optics and pointing. so how to evaluate and calibrate them? you need a reference that is known exactly...

we would use asteroids - this was the texas minor planet project. with ray duncombe’s group in the center for space research and aerospace department, we could refine knowledge of asteroid orbits to the point where their predicted positions and motions were more exact than hst observations. the primary tools for this would be a dec vax cluster at csr, the astronomy department vax running bsd unix, various unix and vms workstations, and the eightytwo inch telescope at mcdonald. it could image an asteroid on a glass photographic plate, given enough time. guiding during the long exposure depended on a data general nova minicomputer and a suitcase sized camera.

this was the cass cam - an advanced piece of eighties hardware. guiding used an image dissector, a photomultiplier tube attached to the side of the camera and looking a bit like a motor part. its circular field of view was divided into four quadrants. a star in the camera focal plane was placed in the center, and the closed loop control system was activated. every second, with a loud mechanical click, the system would adjust the camera position to keep the guide star in the center of the image dissector. to get a feel for how analog this all was, picture the start of a night of observing…

down in the control room which curved in a ring below the dome main floor, the minicomputer had to be booted and master programs started. the dome had been opened to equalize temperature as the sun set, and from the control room one could step outside onto the catwalk running around the outside of the dome for a spectacular view of shadows growing out from the mountains across the high desert and an endless blue sky. various minicomputers and other obsolete hardware crowded the control room with abandoned sets for multiple sixties scifi movies. the curvature of the room did nothing to detract from the worn out cold war bunker vibe. neither did the bank of red leds showing the sidereal time and telescope pointing and the eighty character ascii glow from various terminals scattered about.

when it grew dark, it was time to prepare for the first exposure. the stack of plates for the night were resting on a desk in the control room, each its own envelope. time to carry them, carefully, up to the telescope. on entering the dome, it was pitch black except for the glow of another bank of red leds on the main console and the clouds of stars in the open telescope slit. the telescope loomed overhead in the darkness. very carefully climb up onto the circular telescope floor. it moves to keep below the base of the telescope and one could easily walk off the edge high above the dome floor. guiding parameters for the target asteroids had been computed and noted.

when standing below the telescope, the cass cam hangs at eye level. it's a boxy white instrument, and sliding out the plate cover on its bottom opens a rectangular frame of stars large enough to rest your head inside. the shadow of the telescope secondary mirror and its supports are at the center high overhead. this is the focal plane, where a plate will be fastened for exposure. it's time to adjust the secondary for focus. this is done with a knife edge. a plate shaped metal frame is fastened into the focal plane - at its center it holds a straight metal blade. when the telescope is in focus, this blade cuts off the light of a star suddenly and completely. the telescope hand controller is used to move the telescope and place a star at the knife edge. then the secondary mirror is commanded to move in or out with a loud mechanical whir, until the star's light is cut off cleanly. if there is a bit of spare time, the knife edge frame can be replaced with another metal frame holding the eyepiece - a heavy glass lens that requires both hands to lift. peering in, one can see by eye a mysterious and colorful world of planets, nebulas, and spiraling galaxies...

during the exposure the cass cam operates in two modes. in stellar guiding mode the image dissector maintains a lock on a guide star by commanding the cass cam to move relative to the telescope. to prepare for this, the dissector has to be manually locked on to the guide star. the telescope is first pointed directly at the computed position of the asteroid. this means the slow swing of the telescope and dome across the sky, and adjustment of the observing floor height so it's comfortable to work. the asteroid is not visible, but it's now in the field of view of the cass cam plate holder. now to lock the dissector on to a guide star. at the rear of its cylindrical housing is a round phosphorus screen glowing green, not too different from an old school oscilloscope. an x and y axis divide the screen into four quadrants. when the light of a sufficiently bright star falls into the photo multiplier tube at the dissectors heart, photons cascade down and form a dim blob on the screen. with one of these blobs at the center of the screen, the dissector is activated and begins trying to keep the blob there, with a loud mechanical click every second. this steady clicking heartbeat soon fills the silence of the dome.

with the cass cam in guide star tracking mode, each star makes a small dark spot on the plate. now to prepare for mode two. with the high angular resolution and small field of view of the telescope, during an exposure of around ten minutes the motion of asteroids relative to the sky is significant. the relative direction and rate of asteroid motion was computed earlier by the nova down in the control room. the cass cam is bodily rotated relative to the telescope and programmed to move at the appropriate rate so that in mode two the asteroid is motionless relative to the plate. stellar guiding is off. the clicking heartbeat of the image dissector goes silent. the sky turns while the asteroid builds up its own small gaussian peak in the emulsion. then the steady clicking returns. stellar guiding mode again. the result is a dumbbell shape for stars, with two circular peaks connected by a trail. the asteroid is a trail with a single circular peak at its midpoint.

these peaks and trails are visible the next day when the plates are developed. each plate has many dumbbell shaped stellar trails - short or long, thick or thin - and at the center a single ufo shaped asteroid. now the next stage begins - extracting an asteroid’s position from a plate and improving knowledge of its orbit. this takes place back in austin. here the center for space research and department of aerospace engineering become involved. they play an important role in the hst astrometry group, providing expertise in orbit determination. ray duncombe was a leader of the field from sputnik onward. in 1990 the space age was roughly thirty years old, and the center for space research was the first generation, involved from the beginnings - ray, byron tapley, and bob schutz. 

before numerical orbit analysis can proceed the plates have to be measured. plates are reduced to numerical values using an old school densitometer scanner and minicomputer controller in the back room of the astronomy department library, on the thirteenth floor of robert lee moore hall. this was my primary job, and i spent many hours in the scanning room. it was cool and filled with the steady roar of electronics fans. much of the room was dark except for computer lights. it was a meditative place. the long back wall was lined with cabinets containing thousands of glass plates. full sky sets of survey plates from palomar and european southern observatory. thousands more small plates from mcdonald. black plastic sheets divided off the back end of the room to keep out stray light, and alone at the center of this cave sat the pds microdensitometer. this was an advanced measuring engine, designed to mechanically scan glass plate images using analog, pre-silicon, pre-laser technology. it’s as interesting a time capsule as the cass cam. at its heart is a vertical beam of light. today it would be a laser, but in the pds normal light from a special bulb at the top is focused into a beam downward through the glass plate mounted on a mechanically driven stage with analog position sensors. a detector below the stage measures the intensity of the light passing through the plate while the stage moves the plate in a raster pattern. all analog. discrete sampling by the minicomputer creates a digital result.

my first observing run at mcdonald was early summer. paul and i made the day long drive to west texas, three or four nights making plates with the eighty two inch, and then the day long drive back to austin. the texas heat was just beginning to get intense. a few days after our return, i made the sweltering walk over to rlm and happily settled into the cool darkness of the scanning room. home was uncomfortably warm during the day in any case. time to scan the first of the plates we had brought back from the observatory. the plate is slightly smaller than a normal sheet of paper and the glass is fairly thin. it feels fragile enough that extra care is natural. held up against background light, the star and asteroid trails are small dark smudges. first step is to secure it to the scanning stage. with the dim light entering the scanning cave, if one’s eye is close to the stage and plate, looking right along their top surface, one can see the dull black trails of photographic emulsion on the surface of the glass. the minicomputer has to be told where on the plate to scan and preparation means manually moving the stage to position the scanning beam at the proper positions. in the top structure of the pds, roughly at eye level, is a circular glass screen. this screen shows a magnified image looking down the scanning beam through the plate and stage. individual dark grains of silver in the emulsion are easily visible on the screen, and when a star trail is in the beam it appears as a furry black worm. this is all old school analog optics - essentially a microscope projecting on the screen. the stage is moved using two finely geared knobs and the coordinates of the scan beam are shown by two sets of red leds on the pds console below the stage. tracing a rectangle around a star trail, the corners are the coordinates for a raster scan, and are read off by eye and typed into the minicomputer.

it’s a tall rack with electronics mounted in cases standing in the back corner. on a table beside the rack is a heavy monitor and console. this was one of the first primitive unix graphical interface systems i got to know well, and already it had the feel of an earlier era. not quite as far back as the era of the eighty two inch telescope or the pds, but early to mid eighties certainly. a scanning session meant creating a set of digitized raster images stored on old school nine track half inch tape, one file for each trail scanned by the pds. a group of files, say thirty to fifty for a plate with a good exposure and lots of stars, is created in the filesystem of the control minicomputer and then written to tape using its sibling above on the sixteenth floor, which has the tape drive. the shift over the border from analog to digital takes place in the seventies style electronics connecting the pds to the minicomputer. 

a few days after scanning that first plate, i went to meet with paul and ray in the aerospace building. i vividly remember stopping and standing still under the texas sun, on the sidewalk leading from rlm to wrw. overhead was the typical hard blue summer sky and little white clouds, and i was already sweating just seconds after coming outside. i was thinking about the plate and suddenly had a flash of deep insight. exactly what were the stars on this plate? how could we identify these stars in order to determine the position of the asteroid trail? was there a program on the big astronomy department computers to do this? the answer was no. there was no easy solution. helping to figure out a practical method for our plates was part of my job. not that an undergrad was expected to solve a grand problem, but at least to sense the depth of the problem and what it meant. how does one identify stars? humans can do it. can an eighties computer system?
