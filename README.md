l0 - unprocessed measurements, hardware dependent

l1 - three dimensional pointing vectors in sensor frames and celestial frame

l2 - higher dimensional feature vectors

approaches

ptq - angles between pointing vectors

knn - similarity of feature vectors

svm - separation of feature vectors

mlp - response to feature vectors

current emphasis is on vectorized processing using blas, atlas, and lapack. concurrency can follow.
