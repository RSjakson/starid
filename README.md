three levels of the lost-in-space problem

l0 - unprocessed measurements, hardware dependent

l1 - three dimensional unit vectors representing stars in sensor and celestial frames

l2 - high dimensional feature vectors representing star patterns

approaches

ptq - angles between unit vectors

knn - similarity of feature vectors

svm - linear and kernel separation of feature vectors

mlp - nonlinear response to feature vectors

the emphasis is on vectorized processing - blas, lapack, etc
