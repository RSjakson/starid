l0 - unprocessed sensor measurements

l1 - three dimensional pointing vectors in sensor frames and celestial frame

l2 - high dimensional feature vectors

approaches

ptq - recognition of pointing vectors using star pair angular separations

knn - recognition of feature vectors using k nearest neighbors

svm - classification of feature vectors using support vector machines

ann - classification of feature vectors using artificial neural networks

current emphasis is on vectorized processing using blas. concurrency can follow.
