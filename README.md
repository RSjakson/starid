l0 - unprocessed sensor measurements

l1 - pointing vectors in sensor frames and the celestial frame

l2 - feature vectors

approaches

ptq - pointing vector classification using star pair angular separations

knn - feature vector classification using k nearest neighbors

svm - feature vector classification using support vector machines

ann - feature vector classification using artificial neural networks

current emphasis is on vectorized processing using blas. concurrency can follow.
