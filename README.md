l0 - unprocessed sensor measurements

l1 - pointing vectors in sensor frames and the celestial frame

l2 - feature vectors

learning methods

ptq - l1 classification using star pair angular separations

knn - l2 classification using k nearest neighbors

svm - l2 classification using support vector machines

ann - l2 classification using artificial neural networks

current emphasis is on vectorized processing using blas
