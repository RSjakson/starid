**learning based star identification**

identify the star at the center of an image using methods based on convolutional networks, support vector machines, etc. a model is trained to transform the input x into the output y.

**rules based heuristic star identification**

uses methods based on geometry, pairs, triangles, pyramids, etc. the transformation from x to y can be as direct as y = Hx. noise due to quantization of image star positions complicates matters.
