**learning based star identification**

given an image of a star pattern, identify the star at the center, using methods based on convolutional networks, support vector machines, etc. 

**rules based heuristic star identification**

uses methods based on geometry, pairs, triangles, pyramids, etc. the transformation from x to y can be direct and deterministic. noise complicates things, and image position quantization generates significant noise.
